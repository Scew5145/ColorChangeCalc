# ColorChangeCalc
Probability Calculator for exploring the ability color change in the CAP and OU metagames

Current functionality: Calculate the probability that pokemon X will have a super effective move on a pokemon with color change after switching in to move Y. Do this for... everything

## Usage

Just run the python file ColorChange.py with no arguments.

## Known Issues:

csv for moves is still missing data for Sword/Shield new moves, as well as CAP moves. We need both before this is fully accurate

Also I might be bad at statistics and may have messed some stuff up, yell at me if you see bugs (Ignus on Smogon, Ignus#6182 on disc)
